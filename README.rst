CyVerse Austria  Workshop
-------------------------

Tools and services workshops cover the major platforms of the CyVerse
cyberinfrastructure (http://www.cyverse.org/) including:

- **Data Store:** Data storage, sharing, metadata management, and the Data Commons
- **Discovery Environment:** A web-based, graphical interface to hundreds of
  bioinformatics tools
- **Atmosphere:** Custom cloud computing for life science

Workshop topics build progressively along a ‘path’ most researchers will need to
take from data upload through to analysis and publication, cluminating in an
illustrative science use case (commonly RNA-Seq).

**Who Should Attend**

Faculty, Postdocs, graduate students who use and analyze biological data of all
types (genomics, image data, from animals, plants, etc.).

**Workshop Level**

This workshop focused on beginning users with little to no previous bioinformatics
experience.

Intermeidate and advanced users attend to better understand CyVerse capabilities
and resources, including installing their own tools and extending these analyses
into Cloud and HPC.

    * - Atmosphere Access
      - After registering for a CyVerse account, you will need to request access
        to Atmosphere. Instructions for registering for access are `here <https://cyverse-atmosphere-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_
        (See note marked **Important**). **Atmosphere Access may take 24 hours**
        so please do this in advance. **Verify your Atmosphere Access** by `logging in here <https://atmo.cyverse.org/>`_.
        For justification, you can indicate you are requesting access for a workshop.
      - Request Atmosphere access at the CyVerse user portal `http://user.cyverse.org/`_
    * - Cyberduck
      - Cyberduck is a third-party tool for uploading/downloading data to CyVerse.
        Currently, this tool is available for Windows/MacOS only. You will need
        to download Cyberduck and the connection profile. We will go through
        configuration and installation at the workshop.
      - - `Download Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`_
        - `Download CyVerse Cyberduck connection profile <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/download/attachments/18188197/iPlant%20Data%20Store.cyberduckprofile?version=1&modificationDate=1436557522000&api=v2>`_

**Optional Download Extras**

Host Prep Instructions
----------------------

These instructions are reminders for those hosting a CyVerse Workshop with us or
on their own.

**Internet and Wi-Fi**

Good Wi-Fi is essential to this internet-based workshop. We would advise checking
with your local IT on the ability to connect 20-40 laptops in the room you are
using. Hopefully, you or others have experience on using the space you have reserved.
In addition, please consider that not every attendee may be local (including your CyVerse
traininer) and so restruction-free/guest public Wi-Fi access should be available.

  .. Important::

     On Guest/public Wi-Fi it is not uncommon for certian ports needed to
     communicate with CyVerse services may be blocked. In our experience, IT
     is usually willing to open these ports (or provide temporary gues
     login) for the duration of the workshop. The following ports are needed
     for the workshop:

     - **iRODS/Data Store:** 1247 and 20000-20399
     - **SSH:** 22
     - **VNC:** 5900-5910, 6900-6910
     - **RStudio:** 8787
     - **Jupyter:** 8888±10

Your CyVerse instructor will test connection prior to the workshop, or work with
you to test connection to services.

**Room Spaces/Computer labs**

Our workshops are one to several days in length. A good space will have:

 - Windows (with shades), ventillation and resonably comfortable chairs
 - Sufficent powerstips or power access for laptop users.
 - One or more large projection screens with bright projectors
 - Accomidation for attendees with mobility/hearing/vision difficulties

 If using a Computer Lab, we recommend having the Prerequisite and Download Extras
 installed if possible.

About CyVerse

its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational
infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus
enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms
provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud
services, APIs, and more.

While originally created with the name iPlant Collaborative to serve
U.S. plant science communities, CyVerse cyberinfrastructure is germane
to all life sciences disciplines and works equally well on data from
plants, animals, or microbes. By democratizing access to supercomputing
capabilities, we provide a crucial resource to enable scientists to find
solutions for the future. CyVerse is of, by, and for the community, and community-driven needs
shape our mission. We rely on your feedback to provide the
infrastructure you need most to advance your science, development, and
